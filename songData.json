"b'\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nI once knew a nigga whose real name was William\\nHis primary concern was makin\\' a million\\nBein\\' the illest hustler that the world ever seen\\nHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams\\nA corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen\\nNigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\\nShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\\nHer son\\'s heart simultaneously grew colder\\nHe started hangin\\' out, sellin\\' bags in the projects\\nCheckin\\' the young chicks, lookin\\' for hit-and-run prospects\\nHe was fascinated by material objects\\nBut he understood money never bought respect\\nHe built a reputation, \\'cause he could hustle and steal\\nBut got locked once and didn\\'t hesitate to squeal\\nSo criminals he chilled with didn\\'t think he was real\\nYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equal\\nI don\\'t project my insecurities in other people\\nHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\\nSo he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\\nA feeble-minded young man with infinite potential\\nThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental\\nCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\\nDancin\\' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed\\nBut he was sick of sellin\\' trees, and gave in to his greed\\n\\n[Hook]\\nEveryone tryin\\' to be trife never face the consequences\\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\\nAsk a nigga doin\\' life if he had another chance\\nBut then again, there\\'s always the wicked that knew in advance\\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\\nBut that\\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\\nDevils used to be God\\'s angels that fell from the top\\nThere\\'s no diversity, because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nSo Billy started robbin\\' niggas, anything he could do\\nTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\\nStartin\\' fights over little shit up on the block\\nStepped up to sellin\\' mothers and brothers the crack rock\\nWorkin\\' overtime for makin\\' money for the crack spot\\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\\nFulfillin\\' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\\nTired of the block niggas treatin\\' him the same\\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\\nBut when he tried to step to \\'em, niggas showed him no love\\nThey told him any motherfuckin\\' coward can sell drugs\\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\\nBut only a real thug can stab someone \\'til they die\\nStandin\\' in front of them, starin\\' straight into their eyes\\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\\nSuggested rapin\\' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\\nSo now he had a choice between goin\\' back to his life\\nOr makin\\' money with made men up in the cyph\\'\\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\\n\\n[Hook]\\nEveryone tryin\\' to be trife never face the consequences\\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\\nAsk a nigga doin\\' life if he had another chance\\nBut then again, there\\'s always the wicked that knew in advance\\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\\nBut that\\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\\nDevils used to be God\\'s angels that fell from the top\\nThere\\'s no diversity, because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin\\'\\nSmokin\\' blunts, drinkin\\' and jokin\\' for entertainment\\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin\\' alone\\nThree in the mornin\\', comin\\' back from work, on her way home\\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\\nWalkin\\' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\\n\"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw.\"\\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\\nScreamin\\', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin\\' around!\"\\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he\\'d broken her jaw\\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin\\'\\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin\\'\\nBlood leakin\\' through the cloth, she cried silently\\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\\nRippin\\' her up and chokin\\' her until her throat burned\\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren\\'t concerned\\nWhen they were done and she was lyin\\'\\nBloody, broken and bruised\\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two\\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she\\'d gone through\\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\\n\\n[Sample]\\nI\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back\\nI\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back\\n\\n[Verse 4]\\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\\nAnd he felt strong standin\\' along with his new brothers\\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\\n\\'Cause he was starin\\' into the eyes of his own mother\\nShe looked back at him and cried \\'cause he had forsaken her\\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin\\' her\\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn\\'t even contemplate\\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\\nWorkin\\' hard for nothin\\', because now what was he worth?\\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\\nAnd cryin\\' out to the sky, \\'cause he was lonely and scared\\nBut only the Devil responded, \\'cause God wasn\\'t there\\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\\nAnd listen, \\'cause the story that I\\'m tellin\\' is true\\n\\'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\\nIn fact, I\\'m sure he\\'s standin\\' among one of you at my shows\\nAnd every street cypher, listenin\\' to little thugs flow\\nHe could be standin\\' right next to you, and you wouldn\\'t know\\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\\nWhite, brown, yellow and black  color is not restricted\\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you\\'re inflicted\\nAnd you\\'ll be one of God\\'s children that fell from the top\\nThere\\'s no diversity, because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot\\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never\\nBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever\\nHIDDEN TRACK: \"DIABOLICAL\"\\n\\n[Intro: Immortal Technique]\\nOh, y\\'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?\\nWell, its not, you didnt count on a fallen angel gettin\\' back\\nInto the grace of God and comin\\' after you\\nYall niggas aint shit, your producers aint shit\\nYour fuckin\\' A & R aint shit\\nIll fuckin\\' wipe my ass with your demo deal\\nYo, Diabolic, take this motherfuckers head off!\\n\\n[Verse 1: Diabolic]\\nGo head and grip Glocks\\nIll snap your trigger finger in six spots\\nYoull have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots\\nIll watch you topple flat\\nPut away your rings and holla back\\nCant freestyle; youre screwed off the top, like bottle caps\\nBeneath the surface\\nIm overheatin your receiving circuits\\nBy unleashin\\' deeper verses than priests speak in churches\\nWhat you preach is worthless\\nYour worship defeat the purpose\\nLike President Bush takin\\' bullets for the secret service\\nBeyond what y\\'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap em\\nShow no compassion, like havin a straight-faced orgasm\\nTour jack em, have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friends dick\\nIn the mean time, you can french kiss this clenched fist\\nDiabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin\\' cancer plague\\nFist-fuckin a pussys face, holdin\\' a hand grenade\\nSo if I catch you bluffin\\', faggot, youre less than nothin\\'\\nI just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction\\n\\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\\nYou motherfuckers are nothin\\', you cannot harm me\\nIll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army\\nStorm the planet, huntin\\' you down, cause Im on a mission\\nTo split your body into a billion one-celled organisms\\nImmortal Techniquell destroy your religion, you stupid bitch\\nYoure faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix\\nIm \\'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips\\nArsenic language transmitted revolutionarily\\nIm like time itself: Im gonna kill you inevitably\\nChemically bomb you, fuck usin a chrome piece\\nIm illmatic, you wont make it home, like Jeromes niece\\nIll sever your head diagonally for thinkin\\' of dissin\\' me\\nAnd then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy\\nThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology\\nSo youre nothin\\', like diversity without equality\\nAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology\\nUsin\\' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven\\nProduces more digits than 22 divided by 7\\nYoure like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect\\nYou never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin\\' thug yet\\nYour mind is empty and spacious\\nLike the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist\\nFace it, youre too basic, youre never gonna make it\\nLike children walkin\\' through Antarctica, butt-naked\\n\\n'", "page_views": 700342}, "701": {"url":

ten centuries, impressions and memories\\nThe first time-machine inventor will mention me\\nCanibus was a visionary indeed\\nHe believed light could travel in multiples of C\\nThe organic supercomputer that solved the mysteries of\\nKlein Kaluza with two blue metric rulers\\nLiked Cool J, but thought Stephen Jay Gould was cooler\\nAnd he never liked to propagate rumors\\nSmoked Canary Island cigars\\nLiked American luxury cars and beautiful Asian broads\\nHe had a strong mind, he used to philosophize\\nAbout rhymes while he was pruning his bonsai\\nHe claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time\\nBut he would never take it out his archives\\nHe wrote two songs per day\\nAnd was constantly experimenting with his wordplay\\nIn his youth he did a report on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\\nHe got an F but he deserved an A\\nI followed his career from the first day\\nIt seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways\\nI seen him pull in twenty-four hour workdays\\nWith deferred pay, undeterred by the word \"shame\"\\nPublic humiliation was the worst pain\\nHe was spinning out of control like a Class 5 hurricane\\nHe said he wouldn\\'t want another MC to suffer the same\\nEspecially when there\\'s nothing to gain\\nHe was the illest alive but nobody would face it\\nHe spit till his tongue was too torched to taste it\\nProperly funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations\\nTo extract the information\\nThey found it utterly amazing\\nThey claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting\\nNever mattered to him that art galleries hated him\\n\\'Cause Thomas Kinkade called and said he would take ten\\nComplete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language\\nWith sound but without shape or signature\\nKept files in his garage on MS-DOS\\nIn a fire-proof pod, we thought it was odd\\nOutside there was a shed with an Oppenheimer lock\\nHe apparently kept more wax then Madame Tussaud\\'s\\nWe were in total awe \\'cause it blew our minds\\nSo many rhymes that were intricately designed\\nHe was Poet Laureate of his time\\nAnd if you don\\'t mind, I\\'d like to share some of his rhymes\\nAlone in my room looking through the 32X telescope zoom\\nAdjusting the focus of the moon\\nOne should not assume the philosophy of David Hume\\nIs nothing more then a subjective conclusion\\nWhat is the maximum field rate application?\\nThe runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin\\nAffects the population fluctuation\\nOn a continuous basis but that\\'s just the basics\\nThe juxtaposition of Canibus\\' position\\nThe precision of something no other has written\\nWay above and beyond what was intended\\nThe unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence\\nYou didn\\'t go to college obviously\\nI can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology\\nA remarkable odyssey, the rhymes of modern speeds\\nWhen the brain orders the body not to breathe\\nYour competency is not up to speed, you\\'re not in my league\\nYou couldn\\'t possibly be hotter then me\\nOr oppositely your minus twenty-five degrees\\nYou\\'d squeeze but the condensation makes rifle barrels freeze\\nAllow me to speak figuratively, nigga please\\nMy intellectual properties are about the size of Greece\\nYour counselor advised you not to speak\\nMy counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat\\nIn the words of Joseph Heller, \"I learned how to write better\"\\nEven though it sort of irked me\\nHe said he didn\\'t understand the process of the imagination\\nBut he felt he was at its mercy\\nWhich explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces\\nThe reason why nobody\\'s probably ever heard of me\\nCouldn\\'t understand what I mean by ill\\nUnless you try to translate what I print to film\\nThis is the line of reel, the circle of time\\nThe cycle of eternity, the emergence of one line\\nAcademic phonetics render critics tongue-tied\\nI\\'ve personified dry humor of cum laude alumni\\nA wise man sees failure as progress\\nA fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic\\nAnd loses his soul in the process\\nObsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content\\nMy style is masterful, multilateral\\nI could battle a fool and be naturally cruel\\nWords of scorn are a disastrous tool\\nFrom an existentialist\\'s view I\\'m a better rapper than you\\nGrab the mic and rip your physical fabric in two\\nMy attitude is fucked up but admirable\\nDifferent methods interpreted into different forms\\nFrom entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms\\nNot just spitting a poem, theres much more involved\\nThere\\'s much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve\\nForty-eight orders of mechanical laws\\nAnd rays of creational cause enhance the cadence of my bars\\nMaybe I am self-absorbed\\nBut that\\'s the effect, to find the cause you should ask my A&R\\nToday is what it is, but only because yesterday was what it was\\nPermitting you heard of Beelzebub\\nA tale of demons and drugs, pissy drunk in the club\\nWith the DJ doing the needle rub\\nChances are you\\'ll never see me son\\nYeah I know my name\\'s Canibus but I can\\'t help you if you need a dub\\nI came to holla at some big booty bitches and listen to the speakers thump\\nWhere you get conceited from?\\nI\\'m so nice on the mic they wanna beat me up\\nIt\\'s deep as fuck, I ain\\'t seen it all but I\\'ve seen enough\\nReally unbelievable stuff\\nThere\\'s a lot of times when I want to speak but I\\'m stuck\\nI should leave this rap shit alone\\nAnd kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home\\nMy imagination is my own\\nThe liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone\\nWith a pen in my hand, I bring motion to the Enneagram\\nAnd become \"Can-I Millenium Man\"\\nEngrave my back with the emperor\\'s stamp\\nBeen spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began\\nTrying to escape the wicked empire of Def Jam\\nAnd the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang\\nEvery warrior has an axe to bury\\nBut he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary\\nI said to myself, \"Germaine, this is insane\\nIt\\'s suicide, it\\'s controlled flight into terrain\"\\nI fought to regain control of the plane, but went up in a ball of flames\\nAnd got banned from the Hip-Hop hall of fame\\nFor two bars I kept hearing in my head\\nOver and over again, it cost me everything\\nI\\'m convinced now that more than the truth is at stake\\nWhere people create language that pretends to communicate\\nEuphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes\\nBut its a byproduct of the ghetto music we make\\nFrom an extroverted point of view I think its too late\\nHip Hop has never been the same since \\'88\\nSince it became a lucrative profession\\nThere\\'s a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression\\nEven though the potency of it lessens\\nBig money industries writing checks to suppress the question\\nAnd nobody gives a fuck no more, no one goes to the book store\\nEver since the confluence of Moore\\'s Law\\nBut I stay in the lab like Niels Bohr and his son Aage\\nEdward Lorenz and Leo Szilard\\nLyrically I took rap music and turned the knob\\nTo the right full throttle and added panache\\nWhy would I argue with my own conscience over the truth?\\nThat\\'s like me telling myself, \"Don\\'t tell me what to do\"\\nDialyses and analyses of battle MCs\\nSometimes I say things I myself can\\'t believe\\nMy lyrical is so skillfully elliptical\\nI can understand how it makes you miserable\\nYou wonder why I never let you play your beats for me\\nOr why I keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy\\nYou wonder what\\'s my infatuation with Alicia Keys\\n\"Canibus why don\\'t you speak to me?\"\\nYo, I meant it when I said no one can shine on a song that features me\\nThat\\'s why I said it so vehemently\\nYou need to replace the hate with respect\\nI\\'m probably the best yet, Poet Laureate\\n\\n[Outro  James Dickey sample]\\nGenerally I take I go with the given, you know, with what comes ta me over, the celestial wireless

beginning of the end\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\\n\\n[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]\\nThe voice of racism preachin' the gospel is devilish\\nA fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist\\nForgetting God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond\\nAnd Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran\\nThey bombed innocent people, tryna murder Saddam\\nWhen you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran\\nThis is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings\\n'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings\\nI break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish\\nThe Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ\\nYou murdered and stole his religion and painting him white\\nTranslated in psychologically tainted philosophy\\nConservative political right wing ideology\\nGlued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation\\nGot my back to the wall 'cause I'm facin' assassination\\nGuantanamo Bay, federal incarceration\\nHow could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave\\nIndigenous holocaust and the home of the slaves\\nCorporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm\\nYou really think this country never sponsored terrorism\\nHuman rights violations, we continue the saga\\nEl Savador and the contras in Nicaragua\\nAnd on top of that, you still wanna take me to prison\\nJust 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism\\n\\n[Refrain: Immortal Technique]\\nIt's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain\\nSuggestive thinking causing your perspective to change\\nThey wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto\\nThe fourth branch of the government want us to settle\\nA bandanna full of glittering generality\\nFightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality\\nRead about the history of the place that we live in\\nAnd stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children\\n\\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\\nFlow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs\\nBroken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage\\nThe brink of holy war, bottled up like a miscarriage\\nEmbedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension\\nAnd they refuse to even mention European intervention\\nOr the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams\\nU.S. manufactured missles and M-16's\\nWeapon contracts and corrupted American dreams\\nMedia censorship blocking out the video screens\\nA continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain\\nDemocracy is just a word when the people are starvin'\\nThe average citizen made to be blind to the reason\\nA desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin'\\nAnd the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom\\n'Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon\\nIt's open season with the CIA buggin' my crib\\nTrapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid\\nWhere nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live\\nI'm tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life\\nBut when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique\\nWho beheaded the President and the princes and sheiks\\nYou don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade\\nLike a fallen angel standing in the presence of God\\nBitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard\\n\\n[Refrain: Immortal Technique]\\nIt's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain\\nSuggestive thinking causing your perspective to change\\nThey wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto\\nThe fourth branch of the government want us to settle\\nA bandanna full of glittering generality\\nFightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality\\nMartial law is coming soon to the hood, to kill you\\nWhile you hanging your flag out your project window\\n\\n[Outro: Immortal Technique]\\nThe fourth branch of the government AKA the media\\nSeems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials\\nAs if their opinion was at all unbiased\\nA machine shouldn't speak for men\\nSo shut the fuck up you mindless drone\\nAnd you know it's serious\\nWhen these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign\\nTo try to convince you they're fair and balanced\\nWhen they're some of the most ignorant, and racist people\\nGiving that type of mentality a safe haven\\nWe act like we share in the spoils of war that they do\\nWe die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards\\nWe don't get weapons contracts, nigga\\nWe don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga\\nWe are cheap labor, nigga\\nTurn off the news and read, nigga\\nRead... read... read\\n\\n\"", "page_views": 99969}, "753": {"url": "https://genius.com/Ghostface-killah-mighty-healthy-lyrics", "title": "Mighty Healthy",

(yeah boy)\\nI said I\\'m ready for whatever, hey hey\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nEven though my head in the clouds, I\\'m planted on the pavement\\nHow I walk around, people starin\\' at amazement\\nAnd I play a lot of game on where I be and I ain\\'t playin with it\\nThey so judgmental, maybe they don\\'t understand\\nIf your life was in jeopardy e\\'ryday, is you tellin me\\nYou wouldn\\'t need weaponry just because of your felony?\\nConsider this at least, I got e\\'rybody sweatin me\\nOn the streets is people who won\\'t rest unless I rest in peace\\nKilled my folk a year ago, still in my sleep they threaten me\\nParanoia stressin me, ain\\'t nobody protectin me\\nI\\'m dealin with the pressure from my partner dyin next to me\\nNo one\\'s arrested, they comin for me eventually\\nThis was all the things I was goin through mentally\\nThis could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary\\nNot mentioning New Orlean niggas comin in the city\\nKillin all summer long, ain\\'t nobody payin attention\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nNow, is it that hard to understand if you listen?\\nEither die or go to jail, that\\'s a hell of a decision\\nBut I\\'m wrong and I know it, my excuses aren\\'t important\\nI\\'m just tryna let you know that I ain\\'t think I had a choice, for real\\n\\n[Hook]\\nI had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison\\nYou waiting on me to die, you gon\\' be waiting for a minute\\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell \\'em\\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\\nCan\\'t afford the price of fame \\'coz it cost too much\\nPlus these sucka niggas lame and they talk too much\\nReady for whatever, somebody better tell \\'em\\nI be here when the smoke clears and everythin settles, for real\\n\\n[Post-Hook]\\nFor real, for real, ay,

understand, feel me, I was ridin filthy\\n\\'Coz niggas out there plottin, to rob me and kill me\\n500 thousand every year spent on security\\nAnd my future was bright, but now it\\'s gettin blurry\\n\\'Coz niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me\\nBut surely, God\\'ll deliver me up out it\\nI\\'m a fighter to the heart, I forever be about it\\nI\\'m a father to my sons, asset to my community\\nLook at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity\\nMentally, I was focused on not lettin history\\nRepeat itself, thats why heat was kept in the vicinity\\nYes, officially, I broke the law but not maliciously\\nThrough all of the publicity, was anyone considerin\\nMy position and the logic hid in my decision?\\nBut they caught me with it, now I\\'m off to prison, period\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nBut is it that hard to understand if you listen?\\nEither die or go to jail, that\\'s a hell of a decision\\nBut I\\'m wrong and I know it my excuses ain\\'t important\\nI\\'m just tryna let you know that I ain\\'t think I had a choice, for real\\n\\n[Hook]\\n\\n[Post-Hook]\\n\\n[Outro (Spoken)]\\nAy, I said listen, homeboy. You can talk all you want, mayne, you know what I\\'m saying? Everybody talk to the King, you know what I\\'m sayin? Everybody\\'s entitled to an opinion, you know what I\\'m sayin? They like yesterdays, everybody got one\\nBut the fact of the matter remains: if you ain\\'t walk a mile in my shoes and you ain\\'t lived a day in my life, you ain\\'t survive the shit I done survived, you ain\\'t had to deal with the shit I had to deal with, homeboyyou can\\'t muhfuckin\\' judge me, partner\\nI mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor. You know what they said?\\nThey said, had he had a strap, he\\'da lived today. You know what I\\'m sayin?\\nNow, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?\\nNow, for all of y\\'all who think I was just ridin\\' around on some dumb shit: you know I\\'m smarter than you man! You know I\\'m smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin\\' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner\\nAy, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can\\'t expect me to think like you, \\'cause my life ain\\'t like yours, you know what I\\'m sayin?\\nIf you don\\'t understand that, you don\\'t understand English.

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he\\'s like \"Who that spittin?\" I\\'m like \"It\\'s me.\" He\\'s like \"Oh, well okay.\"\\nUhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth\\nJust askin me to send him beats, and I\\'m thinking he\\'s trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with\\n\\nSo won\\'t you raise your glass won\\'t you\\nSo won\\'t you raise your glass won\\'t you\\nSo won\\'t you raise your glass won\\'t you\\nSo won\\'t you raise your glass won\\'t you\\n\\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\\n\\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\\n\\n[Saxophone Solo]\\n\\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin\\' me or not but he\\'s like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\\n\\n[Hiphop: \"I\\'ll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\\n\\nI\\'m like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that\\'s how I got in the game. If it wasn\\'t for that, I wouldn\\'t be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn\\'t poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that\\'s what we wore back then\\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he\\'s like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren\\'t soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it\\'s kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can\\'t be Life.\"\\n\\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I\\'m sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there\\'s a time in every man\\'s life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\\n\\n[Jay-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\\n\\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\\n\\n[Jay-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\\n\\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain\\'t want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\\n\\n[Jay-Z: \"so what you think of this?\"]\\n\\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I\\'m sayin\\', man what I\\'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I\\'m, I\\'m just in Chicago, I\\'m trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I\\'m trying to get on, and like there wasn\\'t nothin really like poppin\\' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I\\'m just straight holdin\\' the phone, gettin\\' the bad news that dude was tryin\\' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain\\'t have to deal with the landlord cause he\\'s a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\\n\\n[Mother: \"Come on, let\\'s just go\"]\\n\\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn\\'t even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\\n\\n[Mother: \"Kanye, baby, we\\'re here\"]\\n\\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans\\' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\\n\\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon\\' like this one right here\"]\\n\\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like \\'OOOOOOOOOOH.\\' Two days later I\\'m in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn\\'t know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what\\'s up I\\'m Kanye.\"\\n\\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\\n\\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\\n\\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\\n\\nYou know I ain\\'t talkin shit. I\\'m like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I\\'m starstruck, man. I\\'m still thinking \\'bout, you know I\\'m picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I\\'m lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the \\'Can\\'t be Life\\' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn\\'t know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I\\'m killin y\\'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that\\'s all the response. He said \"man that was tight.\"\\n\\n[Jay-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\\n\\nThat was it. You know, I ain\\'t get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn\\'t have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R\\'s, and they wanted beats from me, so they\\'d call me up, I\\'d play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I\\'ll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I\\'ll play my shit. I\\'ll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin\\' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain\\'t have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \\'Jesus Walks\\' and they didn\\'t sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R\\'s that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it\\'d be somebody at the company that\\'ll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\\n\\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y\\'all don\\'t sign Kanye, for real.\"]\\n\\nI\\'m not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up\\n\\n[\"Y\\'all niggas is stupid\"]\\n\\nLet\\'s just say I didn\\'t get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn\\'t even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\\n\\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\\n\\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it\\'s not wack.\"\\n\\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it\\'s not wack.\"]\\n\\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it\\'s a song that you\\'ll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it\\'s called \\'Wow.\\'\\nI go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\\nI got eleven plaques on my walls right now\\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"Like the chorus went. Don\\'t bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he\\'s like \"oh shit\"\\n\\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it\\'s not even wack.\"]\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t gonna front, it\\'s kinda hot.\"\\n\\n[Dame: \"it\\'s actually kinda hot.\"]\\n\\nLike they still weren\\'t looking at me like a rapper. And I\\'m sure Dame figured, \\'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he\\'s like \"yo man, B, B, you don\\'t want a brick, you don\\'t want a brick\"\\n\\n[Dame: \"you don\\'t wanna catch a brick\"]\\n\\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you\\'ll get rained on.\" I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I\\'m a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I\\'m not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he\\'s just a producer rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I\\'m talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\\n\\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\\n\\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don\\'t know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever.

Year's\\nAnd all through the fucking projects\\nNot a handgun was silent, not even a Tec\\nOutsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear\\nAnd blasted on the spot before the pigs were there\\nYou know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight\\nFuck blue and white\\nThey escape before them flash the fucking lights\\nGunshots, shatter first-floor window panes\\nShells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game\\nWhether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it\\nBeat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses\\nBut with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses\\nTherefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless\\nLinks was snatched off necks, scars on throats\\nJackets took, after bullet rips through coats\\nAgainst those who felt the cold from the steel made 'em fold\\nAnd squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill\\nConstruction worker, who was caught for his bomber\\nNo time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmers\\nAnd it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs\\nAnd pockets dug from everything except check stubs\\nAnd it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville\\nOr fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look\\nFor fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops\\nFor his cream he stashed in a shoebox\\nBut he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers\\nYou don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars\\nAnd born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets\\nThose who try to flee they hit the vertebrae\\nIncrease the murder rate\\nSimilar to hitmen who pull out Tecs and then\\nDrop those who crack like tacos from Mexican\\nRapid, like recipients cashing checks again\\nBack to the motherfucking spot on Lexington\\n\\n[Hook x2: Life]\\nBabies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked\\n[Shit is deep

tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay\\nMadness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight\\nStick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light\\nAnd I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash\\nJakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast\\nThree-Fifteen-Sevens and Forty-Fours\\nBought inside corner stores, provide sparks for wars\\nHospital floors surrounded by the law\\nHomicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door\\nMy hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team\\n'Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM\\nSome niggas in the jet-black Galant\\nShot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont\\nI thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid\\nAnd hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled\\nTactical narcotic task force, back off fast\\n'Cause the crime boss is passing off cash\\nExtortions for portions of streets, causes beef\\nHaving followers of Indians trying to play Chief\\nYou witness the saga, casualties and

young shorty in Sierra Leone\\nOr other conflict countries that people call home\\nI figured I would never go to Angola\\nSo it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly\\nThat my neck leash was

go\\nFuck around and miss the show\\nSo I told her to hold that thought real tight\\nWe can finish where we left off later on tonight\\nBack to the scene of the crime on time\\nAs they introduced the fiend of a rhyme\\nShe stood in the crowd with a birds-eye view of me\\nThinking of later on of what she would do to me\\nThe back of the room I could see her eyes - gloom\\nPatient, but hoping that the show was over soon\\nAs the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row\\nSo I said lets go\\nI packed my mic as they screamed for an encore\\nThe speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore\\nBesides I got places to go, ladies to see\\nAnd she could tell me how crazy she was over me\\nWe drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed\\nAnd couldnt wait to get \\'soft and warm\\', I said\\n\"I was watching you, watching me\\nLooks I received made it hard to MC\"\\nI can take a hint, so I knew that she\\nWanted my agony agony ag-on-y in her bod-y\\nDrove to some sights, then I took her to the condo\\nShe was pipin hot, but I kept my calm so\\nShe asked how come I dont smile\\nI said, everythings fine, but Im in a New York state of mind\\nAs we reached the kingdom, she said bring some\\nChampagne, shell entertain then sing some\\nSentimental, songs real gentle\\nIt hit the spot and you know where it went to\\nAs we embraced I felt her heart pumpin\\nI

wait\\nAcknowledge the rep\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nYeah I heard of the Boogiemann when I was a youth, scary\\nAnd I found out that he was as fake as a tooth-fairy\\nSince my last mission this nigga's been ass-kissing\\nI took a minute, I gave your single a fast listen\\nTell me this, with no pot to piss in, how you dissing\\nYour group homes are about to be reporting you missing\\nAnd I don't know what was worse, the track or the verse\\nI'ma get to your producer, but I'm smacking you first\\nSee I couldn't even find one nigga that heard of you\\nI did find a few cats that wanted to murder you\\nBut I told 'em chill, I let 'em know you was my son\\nAnd I promise I can pay support til' you twenty-one\\nConsider me the clothes on your back and a warm meal\\nWho knows, this might just get you a deal\\nAnd the day that your album go on sale for the first hour\\nJust remember like Nas nigga, I Gave You Power\\nI figured I give ya some help, cause you need lots\\nI make your producer change his name to Speed Nottz\\nTell him I say fuck him for doing the tracks\\nMatter of fact, fuck Fat Beats, for doing the wax\\nI'ma diss you via e-mail and then through a fax\\nI'ma diss you by two-way, I ain't gon' never relax\\nI'ma diss you over fast, slow track or no track\\nIf your shit wasn't so whack, I dissed you to your track\\nYou that little fish that I catch and I throw back\\nAnd by the way, give 50 Cent his flow back\\nYou that cat in the club that get hit with a bottle\\nFucking with me, you better off trying to hit lotto\\nAnd don't answer back, this is hard shit to follow\\nAnd

sellin\\' mothers and brothers the crack rock\\nWorkin\\' overtime for makin\\' money for the crack spot\\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\\nFulfillin\\' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\\nTired of the block niggas treatin\\' him the same\\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\\nBut when he tried to step to \\'em, niggas showed him no love\\nThey told him any motherfuckin\\' coward can sell drugs\\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\\nBut only a real thug can stab someone \\'til they die\\nStandin\\' in front of them, starin\\' straight into their eyes\\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\\nSuggested rapin\\' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\\nSo now he had a choice between goin\\' back to his life\\nOr makin\\' money with made men up in the cyph\\'\\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\\n\\n[Hook]\\nEveryone tryin\\' to be trife never face the consequences\\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\\nAsk a nigga doin\\' life if he had another chance\\nBut then again, there\\'s always the wicked that knew in advance\\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\\nBut that\\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\\nDevils used to be God\\'s angels that fell from the top\\nThere\\'s no diversity, because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin\\'\\nSmokin\\' blunts, drinkin\\' and jokin\\' for entertainment\\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin\\' alone\\nThree in the mornin\\', comin\\' back from work, on her way home\\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\\nWalkin\\' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\\n\"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw.\"\\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\\nScreamin\\', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin\\' around!\"\\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he\\'d broken her jaw\\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin\\'\\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin\\'\\nBlood leakin\\' through the cloth, she cried silently\\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\\nRippin\\' her up and chokin\\' her until her throat burned\\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren\\'t concerned\\nWhen they were done and she was lyin\\'\\nBloody, broken and bruised\\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two\\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she\\'d gone through\\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\\n\\n[Sample]\\nI\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back\\nI\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back\\n\\n[Verse 4]\\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\\nAnd he felt strong standin\\' along with his new brothers\\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\\n\\'Cause he was starin\\' into the eyes of his own mother\\nShe looked back at him and cried \\'cause he had forsaken her\\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin\\' her\\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn\\'t even contemplate\\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\\nWorkin\\' hard for nothin\\', because now what was he worth?\\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\\nAnd cryin\\' out to the sky, \\'cause he was lonely and scared\\nBut only the Devil responded, \\'cause God wasn\\'t there\\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\\nAnd listen, \\'cause the story that I\\'m tellin\\' is true\\n\\'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\\nIn fact, I\\'m sure he\\'s standin\\' among one of you at my shows\\nAnd every street cypher, listenin\\' to little thugs flow\\nHe could be standin\\' right next to you, and you wouldn\\'t know\\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\\nWhite, brown, yellow and black  color is not restricted\\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you\\'re inflicted\\nAnd you\\'ll be one of God\\'s children that fell from the top\\nThere\\'s no diversity, because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot\\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never\\nBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever\\nHIDDEN TRACK: \"DIABOLICAL\"\\n\\n[Intro: Immortal Technique]\\nOh, y\\'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?\\nWell, its not, you didnt count on a fallen

over, you\\'re making it home\\nAnd trying to sleep before the break of dawn\\nAnd while ya sleeping you start to dream\\nAnd thinking how ya danced on the disco scene\\nA name appears in your mind\\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\\nIt was phase two just a doing a do\\nRocking ya down cause ya know we could\\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak\\nCome alive girls get

sweeter than honey\\nLike a millionaire that has no money\\nLike a rainy day that is not wet\\nLike a gambling fiend that does not bet\\nLike Dracula with out his fangs\\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang\\nLike collard greens that don\\'t taste good\\nLike a tree that\\'s not made out of wood\\nLike going up and not coming down\\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\\nTo the beat beat, ya do the freak\\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\\nHave you ever went over a friend\\'s house to eat\\nAnd the food just ain\\'t no good\\nI mean the macaroni\\'s soggy the peas are mushed\\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\\nBy saying that you\\'re full\\nAnd then your friend says \"momma he\\'s just being polite\\nHe ain\\'t finished uh-uh that\\'s bull\"\\nSo your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\\nAnd you say that you already ate\\nAnd your friend says \"man there\\'s plenty of food\"\\nSo you pile some more on your plate\\nWhile the stinky food\\'s steaming your mind starts to dreaming\\nOf the moment that it\\'s time to leave\\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken\\'s slowly rotting\\nInto something that looks like cheese\\nOh so you say that\\'s it I got to leave this place\\nI don\\'t care what these people think\\nI\\'m just sitting here making myself nauseous\\nWith this ugly food that stinks\\nSo you bust out the door while its still closed\\nStill sick from the food you ate\\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\\nFrom a bottle of kaopectate\\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\\nTo see how he has been\\nAnd he says \"I understand about the food\\nBaby but bubbah we\\'re still friends\"\\nWith a hip hop the hippie, to the hippie\\nThe hip hip a hop a you don\\'t stop the rocking\\nTo the bang bang boogie\\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\\nI say \"Hank can ya rock?\\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don\\'t stop?\\nCan ya hip me to the shoobie doo\"\\nI said \"come on, make uh, make the people move\"\\n\\n[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]\\nI go to the halls and then ring the bell\\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well\\nI\\'m big bang, I got clientele\\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\\nI never forgot what I was told\\nIt was the best advice that I ever had\\nIt came from my wise dear old dad\\nHe said \"sit down punk I wanna talk to you\\nAnd don\\'t say a word until I\\'m through\\nNow there\\'s a time to laugh a time to cry\\nA time to live and a time to die\\nA time to break and a time to chill\\nTo act civilized or act real ill\\nBut whatever ya do in your lifetime\\nYa never let a MC steal your rhyme\"\\nSo from six to six \\'til this very day\\nIll always remember what he had to say\\nSo when the sucker emcees try to chump my style\\nI let them know that I\\'m versatile\\nI got style, finesse and a little black book\\nThat\\'s filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\\nBut there\\'s a thing that separates you from me\\nAnd that is called originality\\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you heard\\nI didn\\'t even bite and not a godd--m word\\nAnd I say a little more later on tonight\\nSo the sucker emcees can bite all night\\nUh, tick a tock y\\'all, a beat, beat

and\\nHand shaking, laughing, and exchangin\\' all they math again\\nYou usually lose touch when you travelin\\'\\nA few dudes bruised up in the battlin\\'\\nParked on Madison across from the Radisson\\nWe talked about the tattlin\\' some niggas did in Maryland\\nPlus discussed old homicides unravelin\\'\\nI asked, was he dabblin\\', he laughed and said he managin\\'\\nHis Carti frames was as clear as a camera lens\\nHe hardly changed, I was near in comparison\\nWe joked about how police choked him out\\nAnd he claimed as far as fame I had enough to bust in Oprah\\'s mouth\\nIn other words, I was up in clout\\nAnd from the curb I need to pull a Larry Bird, \\'fore I\\'m up and out\\nWithout a sound, snatched my Guinness off the ground\\nRose up, gave him a pound and told him, \"Homie, hold it down\"\\n\\n[Hook]\\nYou know the game insane in the brain\\nBig things in the Range, real niggas never change\\nAnd though we homies and we no longer hang\\nYou know you know me and that love still remains\\nSo through the fame, through the fire and the flames\\nI adapt to the pain, real niggas do the same\\nAnd though we homies and we no longer hang\\nYou know you know me and that love still remains\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nIt was Tuesday when I saw him, figured Friday I could call him\\nWoke up early Wednesday morning, flew a chick in from New Orleans\\nShe ain\\'t that average bitch who be doggin\\' for dick\\nYou know them chicks that get you sick when they keep callin\\'\\nUp in Nordstrom\\'s for a fresh pair to floss \\'em\\nOf course with footwear I be that first nigga that sport \\'em\\nCaught \\'em before the salesmen even had time to assort \\'em\\nBought \\'em before any celeb stylist ever saw \\'em\\nWore \\'em soon as I copped \\'em in the spot playing possum\\nDebating my destination, lacing, weighing my options\\nCelly started rockin\\', I answered, what\\'s poppin\\'\\nThey answered and said, they shot him, now the hood got a problem\\nI had to swallow, reaching out for my water bottle\\nTryin\\' to figure what nigga, why and by who, then\\nBefore you know it, the other voice told it\\nIt was homie from the old clique I just seen and spoke with\\n\\n[Hook]\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nIt\\'s Doe or Die, we survive \\'till we slain\\nAnd it\\'s no surprise, homie was probably high when they came\\nI know the guy, he was fly, him and I was the same\\nA Gemini, with a status symbolized as his name\\nGodly trained, he could camouflage on any terrain\\nCarti frames, we go back like Bartles and James\\nIt\\'s a shame cause they say his baby mom is to blame\\nBut nonchalantly I refrained cause it constantly changed\\nFrom close range, somebody please slowly explain\\nIf they just wanted some jewels why didn\\'t they go for the chain\\nIf they just wanted some news they could\\'ve left him in his Hanes\\nBut no, they just left a nigga breathless and banged\\n\\n[Hook]\\n\\n[Produced by The Heatmakerz]\\n\\n'", "page_views": 11014}, "31":
