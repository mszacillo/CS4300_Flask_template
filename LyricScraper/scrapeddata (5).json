you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom?\nHe rings the bell and she looks out the window, and calls the cops\nI try to explain that he's mostly tame\nAs long as there's pizza and video games\nThat's what you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom\n\nWhile everyone else is running and screaming\nI just love being with you\nI guess they don't see all the things that I'm seein'\nThat make you so uniquely you, you, you, you\n\nWhat do you get when you meet Godzilla and fall in love?\n"}, {"title": "Spaceship", "artist": "Ke$ha", "lyrics": "\n\r\nI always said when I'm

bloodshed, the ocean of human endeavor, it all grows quiet, insignificant.
